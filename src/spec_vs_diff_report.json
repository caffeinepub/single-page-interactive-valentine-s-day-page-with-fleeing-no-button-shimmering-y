  "summary": "Diff adds a frontend “Change Domain” dialog with client-side validation, and a backend `deployApp(domainName)` method that validates and traps on invalid input. However, the diff does not show any mechanism that actually applies/persists the domain as the app’s deployment domain beyond validation.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "A valid domain value (5–50 chars, letters/numbers/hyphens only) is accepted and used for the deployment domain (i.e., actually updates/sets the deployment domain, not just validated).",
      "reason": "Backend `deployApp` currently only runs validation and then does nothing on success; there is no evidence of updating/storing a domain or calling a platform API to set the deployment domain.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (deployApp validates then returns; no update logic shown)"

      "description": "Added a backend migration module with a no-op `run` function.",
      "reason": "REQ-12 is about enabling domain changes and validation; the diff does not provide evidence that a migration module is required for that, and it contains no domain-related logic.",
