  "summary": "The diff implements a pointer/touch-capable fleeing behavior for the “No” button and removes any overlay usage from `App.tsx`, but it also introduces/retains an unrelated dialog (`DeploymentDomainDialog`) that was not requested in the BuildRequest. The `NoConfirmationOverlay` component file still exists (and contains the old overlay strings per the summaries), though it does not appear to be imported/exported in the shown changes.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/rendered `DeploymentDomainDialog` (a dialog/popup UI) in the main App footer, unrelated to the fleeing “No” button requirements.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is specifically about removing the “No” confirmation overlay and making the “No” button flee on mobile/desktop; it does not request adding any new dialogs or deployment-domain UI.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions `frontend/src/features/deployment/DeploymentDomainDialog.tsx` as a shadcn/ui Dialog)"
